#### Architecture Advantages
- **üè¢ China-First Approach**: Identity management center in China, aligning with local governance requirements
- **üîê Unified Security Control**: Mooncake Entra ID centrally manages authentication and authorization policies
- **üåç Global Resource Access**: Seamless access to Global M365 services and Azure resources
- **üìã Compliance Assurance**: Core identity data stored within China borders, meeting data sovereignty requirements

#### Core Authentication Flow
1. **Identity Authentication**: User completes authentication in Mooncake Entra ID (including MFA/Conditional Access)
2. **SAML Federation**: Mooncake as IdP sends SAML assertion to Global tenant
3. **Permission Assignment**: User gains access to Global Azure resources and enterprise applications
4. **Unified Experience**: Single sign-on enables seamless cross-cloud work experience

#### Supported Service Scope

**Mooncake Core Services (Identity Source):**
- Microsoft Entra ID (Unified Identity Management Center)
- Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive (M365 Collaboration Platform)
- Virtual Machine, Application Gateway, SQL Database (Azure Infrastructure)
- Storage Account, Key Vault (Data and Security Services)

**Global Extended Services (Federation Target):**
- Enterprise applications and SaaS services
- Azure global region resources
- Third-party integrated applications

## China Compliance Recommendations

### Data Sovereignty Compliance Checklist

#### ‚úÖ Identity Data Localization
- [ ] Ensure user master identity objects are stored within China (Mooncake)
- [ ] Verify identity authentication logs are stored in compliant data centers
- [ ] Establish data classification and labeling mechanisms for sensitive identity information

#### ‚úÖ Cybersecurity Law Compliance
- [ ] Implement data export security assessment processes
- [ ] Establish cross-border data transfer audit mechanisms
- [ ] Configure appropriate data encryption and transmission security measures

#### ‚úÖ Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) Compliance
- [ ] Obtain explicit user consent for cross-border identity authentication
- [ ] Establish user identity data access and deletion mechanisms
- [ ] Implement data minimization principles, transmitting only necessary identity claims

#### ‚úÖ Critical Information Infrastructure Protection
- [ ] Assess whether the identity system falls under critical information infrastructure
- [ ] Implement corresponding level security protection measures
- [ ] Establish security incident emergency response mechanisms

### Technical Compliance Recommendations

#### üîê Data Encryption Requirements
```powershell
# Ensure SAML assertions use strong encryption algorithms
$SamlConfig = @{
    SigningAlgorithm = "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"
    DigestAlgorithm = "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256"
    EncryptionMethod = "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-cbc"
}
```

#### üè¢ Organizational Boundary Controls
- Configure Conditional Access policies to restrict specific geographic locations
- Implement device compliance requirements
- Enable session controls and monitoring

#### üìä Audit and Monitoring
- Enable comprehensive Azure AD audit logging
- Configure Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration
- Establish anomalous login detection and response mechanisms
